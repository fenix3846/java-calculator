# java-calculator
hello everyone, in this project rather than python we are using java to create a simple calculator

in this project we used the command
import java.util.*;

also essential in java you need to add ';' at the end of every command.

we used-
variables
case
result 
and default commands for this calculator

this one is a basic calcultor , i will surely come up with a more advanced calculator in the fututre.
ENJOY.
